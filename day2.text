Scheduling Algorithms in Operating Systems:

First Come First Serve (FCFS):
The simplest scheduling algorithm where processes are scheduled in the order they arrive.

Shortest Job First (SJF):
Processes with the shortest CPU burst time are scheduled first to minimize waiting time.

Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF):
A preemptive version of SJF. The CPU is assigned to the process with the smallest remaining burst time.

Round Robin (RR) Scheduling:
Each process gets a fixed time slice (quantum) in a cyclic order, allowing fair sharing of the CPU.

Priority-Based Scheduling (Non-Preemptive):
Processes are scheduled based on priority. Higher priority processes run first. If two processes have the same priority, the one that arrived first is scheduled.

Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN):
Schedules processes based on the highest response ratio, calculated as:

Response Ratio = (Waiting Time plus Burst Time) divided by Burst Time
â€‹
 
This algorithm helps avoid starvation of lower priority processes.

Multilevel Queue Scheduling (MLQ):
Processes are divided into different queues based on priority. Higher priority queues are served first. Lower priority queues run only after the higher ones are empty.

Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduling:
Similar to MLQ but allows processes to move between queues based on their CPU burst behavior. If a process uses too much CPU time, it is moved to a lower-priority queue to improve responsiveness.
