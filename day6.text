Key Terms - Operating Systems
Real-time system:
A system with strict, fixed time constraints where tasks must be completed within specific time limits.

Monolithic kernel:
An OS kernel where all system services run in a single large executable.

Microkernel:
A minimal kernel that runs only essential services; other OS services run in user space.

Macro kernel:
A hybrid kernel combining features of both monolithic and microkernels.

Re-entrancy:
A memory-saving technique allowing multiple processes to share the same code simultaneously without conflicts. The program code is not modified, and each process maintains its own local data.

Demand paging:
Only loads a page into memory when it is needed, swapping unused pages to disk.

Virtual memory:
A memory management technique allowing execution of processes larger than physical memory by using disk space as an extension.

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks):
A data storage technology that combines multiple disks to improve performance and provide redundancy. There are 7 common RAID levels.

Logical vs Physical address space:
Logical address is generated by the CPU; physical address is the actual location in memory hardware.

Fragmentation:
Wasted memory space due to inefficient allocation.

Internal fragmentation: Wasted space inside fixed-size blocks.

External fragmentation: Wasted space outside allocated blocks in variable-sized systems.

Spooling:
Temporarily storing data (like print jobs) in a queue to manage device access efficiently.

Starvation:
When a process waits indefinitely for resources because others are always prioritized.

Aging:
A technique to prevent starvation by gradually increasing the priority of waiting processes.

Advantages of multithreaded programming:

Better responsiveness to users

Efficient resource sharing within processes

Cost-effective compared to multiple processes

Full utilization of multiprocessor systems

Thrashing:
A state where excessive paging causes the CPU to spend most time swapping pages instead of executing instructions, drastically reducing performance.
